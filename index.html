            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Acoustic Analysis for Green Mosque Dzarratul Muthmainnah</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">This comprehensive acoustic consultation was conducted for the renovation of Dzarratul Muthmainnah Green Mosque in South Tangerang. The project focused on optimizing speech intelligibility and worship experience through systematic evaluation of room acoustics and sound system performance.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Detailed measurements of reverberation time, speech transmission index, and background noise levels were performed. Computational modeling was then utilized to simulate various design scenarios, leading to evidence-based recommendations for acoustic treatment placement and sound system configuration.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Special consideration was given to maintaining the architectural integrity of the sacred space while implementing acoustic improvements. The proposed solutions balanced technical performance with aesthetic requirements, demonstrating how acoustic design can enhance spiritual experiences without compromising visual design intentions.</p>
            <p>The project outcomes have been implemented in the mosque's renovation, serving as a model for integrating acoustic considerations into religious architecture in tropical climates.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Parametric Study on Transmission Loss of Plenum Windows</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">This investigation systematically evaluated the acoustic performance of plenum window designs through advanced numerical modeling techniques. Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) and Finite-Element Method analyses were employed to assess sound transmission characteristics under various geometric configurations.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Key parameters including glass separation distance, pane overlap dimensions, angular orientations, and the integration of sonic crystal arrays were examined. The study revealed non-linear relationships between geometric modifications and acoustic performance, with particular sensitivity observed in the mid-frequency range.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Practical design guidelines were developed from the findings, enabling architects to optimize window configurations for both noise reduction and natural ventilation requirements. The research contributes to sustainable urban design by facilitating the development of building envelopes that passively mitigate environmental noise pollution.</p>
            <p>Results from this work have been presented at international acoustics conferences and are being considered for incorporation into green building standards in tropical regions.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Transparent Wood as Building Material and Passive Cooling Component</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">This materials research initiative explored the potential of transparent wood composites as multifunctional building elements. Optical, thermal, and mechanical properties were characterized through laboratory testing and computational modeling, with particular attention to their performance in tropical climates.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The investigation demonstrated how lignin-modified wood substrates could simultaneously provide daylight transmission, thermal insulation, and structural capacity. Comparative analyses with conventional glazing systems revealed significant advantages in terms of embodied energy and passive cooling potential.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Prototype facade elements were developed and monitored under real-world conditions, validating simulation predictions about their ability to reduce cooling loads while maintaining visual connectivity with the exterior environment. The material's light-diffusing characteristics were found to enhance indoor visual comfort by reducing glare.</p>
            <p>This work has attracted attention from sustainable architecture practitioners and is being considered for pilot implementation in several green building projects across Southeast Asia.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Development of Baseline and Roadmap for Energy Efficiency in Buildings Across Indonesia</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">This nationwide study established comprehensive energy consumption benchmarks for diverse building typologies across Indonesia's major urban centers. Data was collected through systematic audits of hundreds of buildings, complemented by utility record analysis and occupant surveys.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Statistical models were developed to identify key drivers of energy use intensity, accounting for climatic variations, operational patterns, and building characteristics. The analysis revealed significant opportunities for improvement, particularly in cooling systems and lighting efficiency.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">A tiered implementation roadmap was formulated, prioritizing cost-effective measures with rapid payback periods alongside more comprehensive retrofitting strategies. The recommendations address both technical upgrades and operational improvements, supported by case studies demonstrating successful implementations.</p>
            <p>The findings have informed national energy policy discussions and are being used to guide incentive programs for building retrofits. Several municipal governments have adopted the benchmarks as reference standards for local building regulations.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Green Building Certification (BGH PUPR) of UGM Innovation Center</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">This project involved comprehensive energy modeling and performance analysis to support green building certification for the UGM Innovation and Creativity Center. Both static calculations and dynamic thermal simulations were conducted to evaluate the building's energy consumption patterns and indoor environmental quality.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The assessment covered multiple criteria including energy efficiency, water conservation, indoor air quality, and material sustainability. Innovative features such as hybrid ventilation strategies and responsive shading systems were analyzed through computational fluid dynamics and daylight modeling.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Recommendations were developed to optimize the building's performance while maintaining its architectural vision. The implementation of these measures resulted in a 40% reduction in predicted energy use compared to conventional designs, qualifying the project for Gold-level certification under Indonesia's Green Building rating system.</p>
            <p>The methodologies developed through this project have since been adopted as best practice guidelines for other institutional buildings pursuing green certification
